    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ever since I was a kid my parents every christmas would make gingerbread in a big loaf for the christmas time and it was the <strong>Best</strong>.<br>
       The rich ginger flavour is one of my favourites and the denseness of this cake bread hybrid really bring it to the forefront of this dish.<br>
       Brings a real warm and cozy feeling both from the memories and that cosy ginger taste. Onto the recipe!</p>
